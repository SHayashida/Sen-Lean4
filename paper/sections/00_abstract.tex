\begin{abstract}
We present a proof-carrying, semantics-aware Possibility Atlas pipeline for computational social choice.
The system treats axioms as engineering levers, enumerates SAT/UNSAT regions, extracts boundary explanations (MUS/MCS), and validates UNSAT evidence with LRAT plus Lean kernel checking.
For SAT regions, we add a deterministic gallery extraction layer with solver-independent witness validation against CNF.
Our scope is intentionally small (Sen base case: $n=2$, $m=4$), but the pipeline demonstrates reproducible artifact discipline, explicit safety assumptions for acceleration (monotone pruning and symmetry reduction), and paper-ready evaluation outputs.
