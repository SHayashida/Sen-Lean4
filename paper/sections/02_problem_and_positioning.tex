\section{Problem and Positioning}

We study a fixed finite domain (sen24): two voters, four alternatives, and a social welfare function represented as a binary relation.
Axiom toggles are treated as levers, producing a finite family of SAT instances.

Our positioning is AI/Systems-first with COMSOC relevance:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{AI/Systems}: reproducible pipeline design, schema versioning, solver metadata, and safety checks.
  \item \textbf{COMSOC}: impossibility boundary analysis, minimal contradiction causes (MUS), and minimal repair actions (MCS).
\end{itemize}

The objective is not to claim general $n,m$ theorems, but to establish a high-integrity small-scope platform whose artifacts can be reviewed, rerun, and extended.
