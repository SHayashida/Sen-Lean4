\section{System Design}

The implementation follows four separable layers.

\paragraph{Spec.}
Lean definitions capture relation primitives, axioms, and theorem statements for sen24.

\paragraph{Encode.}
Python generators emit DIMACS CNF with manifests that record schema parameters, per-category clause counts, and hashes.

\paragraph{Solve.}
External SAT solvers produce SAT models or UNSAT proof traces.

\paragraph{Check.}
Trusted checks include: (i) CNF audit scripts against the manifest contract, (ii) LRAT verification in Lean for committed UNSAT references, and (iii) SAT witness validation against CNF.

This separation enables fast heuristic experimentation in Python while preserving proof-carrying trust guarantees in the checking layer.
