\section{Methods}

\subsection{Atlas enumeration}
We enumerate axiom subsets over a fixed universe and solve each case to obtain SAT/UNSAT status.
Outputs include per-case CNF/manifest/summary and top-level \texttt{atlas.json}.

\subsection{Boundary extraction}
For UNSAT solved cases, we run a deletion-based MUS procedure and a small MCS search (single removals first, then bounded pairs).
This provides minimal contradiction and repair evidence at low implementation risk.

\subsection{Proof-carrying UNSAT policy}
For canonical UNSAT references, we retain CNF+LRAT and verify in Lean.
For atlas runs, proof metadata is recorded with hash-based linkage and replay commands.

\subsection{SAT Gallery with witness validation}
SAT cases are filtered by lightweight non-trivial heuristics and ranked deterministically.
Each selected witness is validated against CNF using a solver-independent checker that parses DIMACS and model assignments directly.
