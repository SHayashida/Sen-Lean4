\section{Sen24 Case Study}

The sen24 atlas demonstrates two complementary outcomes:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{UNSAT boundary}: contradiction clusters identified with MUS and repaired with MCS candidates.
  \item \textbf{SAT region}: concrete, validated SAT witnesses after lever relaxation.
\end{itemize}

Figure placeholders (generated by scripts):
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \texttt{paper/figures/generated/frontier\_matrix.png}
  \item \texttt{paper/figures/generated/frontier\_boundary.png}
\end{itemize}

For UNSAT verification, the committed reference case uses LRAT checked by Lean.
For SAT examples, the gallery records deterministic ranking and witness-validation statistics for each selected case.
