\section{Sen24 Case Study}

The sen24 atlas demonstrates two complementary outcomes:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{UNSAT boundary}: contradiction clusters identified with MUS and repaired with MCS candidates.
  \item \textbf{SAT region}: concrete, validated SAT witnesses after lever relaxation.
\end{itemize}

Figure placeholders (generated by scripts):
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \texttt{paper/figures/generated/frontier\_matrix.png}
  \item \texttt{paper/figures/generated/frontier\_boundary.png}
  \item \texttt{paper/figures/generated/frontier\_hasse.png}
\end{itemize}

For UNSAT verification, the committed reference case uses LRAT checked by Lean.
For SAT examples, the gallery records deterministic ranking and witness-validation statistics for each selected case.

\paragraph{Reproducible repair tables.}
For a fully solved atlas run (\texttt{--prune none}), axiom-level repair sets are enumerated with
\texttt{scripts/enumerate\_repairs.py}. The resulting \texttt{mcs\_all}, \texttt{mcs\_min\_size}, and \texttt{mcs\_min\_all} fields in
\texttt{atlas.json} provide inclusion-minimal SAT repairs per UNSAT case.

\paragraph{Validated non-trivial SAT rule cards.}
Each selected SAT gallery entry is accompanied by \texttt{rule\_card.md} and \texttt{rule\_card.tex},
including non-triviality metrics and concrete profile witnesses. SAT assignments are checked with
\texttt{scripts/validate\_sat\_witness.py} before rule cards are emitted.

\paragraph{Triangulation and poset structure artifacts.}
The optimization-side triangulation report is generated as \texttt{repair\_triangulation.md} via
\texttt{scripts/triangulate\_repairs.py}, comparing independent optimum repair sizes against
\texttt{mcs\_min\_size}/\texttt{mcs\_min\_all}. The frontier structure is rendered as a subset-poset/Hasse graph
(\texttt{frontier\_hasse.dot} and \texttt{frontier\_hasse.png}) via \texttt{scripts/plot\_hasse\_frontier.py}.
