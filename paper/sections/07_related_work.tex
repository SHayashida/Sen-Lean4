\section{Related Work and Positioning}

Our position aligns with, but does not replace, existing lines of work:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Constraint Hierarchies}: prioritize conflicting constraints; we focus on explicit SAT/UNSAT atlas structure.
  \item \textbf{ATMS}: track assumption consistency; we add proof-carrying audit artifacts and kernel-level checks.
  \item \textbf{OMT/MAXSAT}: optimize objective values; we prioritize boundary explanation and reproducible verification contracts.
\end{itemize}

The main differentiator is verification-first systems integration: semantics-aware encoding, manifest-audited generation, and proof-carrying checking.
