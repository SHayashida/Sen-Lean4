\section{Limitations and Scope}

This paper intentionally targets a killable instance (sen24).
We do not claim direct scalability to arbitrary $n,m$.

Safe acceleration features (monotone pruning and symmetry reduction) are only valid under explicit assumptions and runtime guards.
These assumptions are specified in:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \texttt{docs/assumptions\_monotone\_pruning.md}
  \item \texttt{docs/safety\_symmetry\_reduction.md}
\end{itemize}

Future work should expand scale while preserving proof-carrying checks and schema-level reproducibility contracts.
