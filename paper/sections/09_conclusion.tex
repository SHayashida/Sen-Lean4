\section{Conclusion}

We provide a practical template for proof-carrying possibility atlases in computational social choice.
The sen24 study shows that small-scope exploration can still produce publishable systems evidence when artifacts are auditable, assumptions are explicit, and SAT/UNSAT outcomes are both explainable.

The immediate next step is controlled expansion of the atlas while preserving the same trust and reproducibility guarantees.
